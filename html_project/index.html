        <h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>When did tacos first appear in United States?</summary>
            <p>
                The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905. Mexican migrants were 
                coming in to work on railroads and other jobs and started to bring their delicious 
                food with them. Tacos were essentially a street food at this time since they were 
                highly portable and cheap.
