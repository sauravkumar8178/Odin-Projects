            &nbsp The history of Indian cuisine consists of cuisine from the Indian 
            subcontinent, which is rich and diverse. The diverse climate in the 
            region, ranging from deep tropical to alpine, has also helped 
            considerably broaden the set of ingredients readily available to the 
            many schools of cookery in India. In many cases, food has become a 
            marker of religious and social identity, with varying taboos and 
            preferences (for instance, a segment of the Jain population consume no 
            roots or subterranean vegetable; see Jain vegetarianism) which has also 
            driven these groups to innovate extensively with the food sources that 
            are deemed acceptable.
  
            <p>
                &nbsp After 9000 BCE, a first period of indirect contacts between Fertile 
                Crescent and Indus Valley seems to have occurred as a consequence of 
                the Neolithic Revolution and the diffusion of agriculture. Around 
                7000 BCE, agriculture spread from the Fertile Crescent to the Indus 
                Valley, and wheat and barley began to be grown. Sesame, and humped 
                cattle were domesticated in the local farming communities. Mehrgarh 
                is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in 
                South Asia. Jean-Fran√ßois Jarrige argues for an independent origin of 
                Mehrgarh who notes "the assumption that farming economy was introduced 
                full-fledged from Near-East to South Asia, and the similarities 
                between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western 
                Indus valley, which are evidence of a "cultural continuum" between 
                those sites. But given the originality of Mehrgarh, Jarrige 
                concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background," and is 
                not a "'backwater' of the Neolithic culture of the Near East."
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp From circa 4500 to 1900 BC the rulers of Lower Mesopotamia were 
                Sumerians who spoke a non-Indo-European and non-Semitic language, 
                may have initially come from India and may have been related to the 
                original Dravidian population of India. This appeared to historian 
                Henry Hall as the most probable conclusion, particularly based on 
                the portrayal of Sumerians in their own art and "how very Indian 
                the Sumerians were in type". Recent genetic analysis of ancient 
                Mesopotamian skeletal DNA tends to confirm a significant association 
                that some of Sumerians might have come from IVC, and it cannot be 
                excluded that among them were people involved in the founding of the 
                Mesopotamian civilizations.

                    &nbsp Travelers to the Indian south are in for a glorious treat. They will not
                    be eating tandoori chicken, lamb curry, nan or other standard fare, but 
                    exotic foods spiced with cinnamon, tamarind and pepper, or fragrant with 
                    coconut and curry leaves.
                    South Indian cuisine still retains many elements of the ancient 
                    Dravidian culture that flourished 4,500 years ago: steamed dumplings 
                    with coconut, jaggery (raw sugar) and cardamom in a rice wrapper; 
                    food served in banana leaves, or the ubiquitous spice blend kari 
                    podi, or curry powder, are all indigenous to this region. 
                    The geographic and cultural seclusion of the South Indian peninsula, 
                    separated from the north by the high Vindhyas, has left southern 
                    cuisine very ''Indian,'' unaffected by outside influences.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp It is represented by four distinct regional styles: Tamil Nadu, 
                    Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Intriguing and diverse, these 
                    regional cuisines reflect the natural resources of each area, as 
                    well as the rich ethnic mixture of its people - Syrian Christians, 
                    Arab or Mogul Muslims, Jains or Sephardic Jews.
                    There are, however, a few unifying elements of southern cooking, 
                    like the use of rice as a staple, as well as certain varieties of 
                    squashes and greens, coconut, jaggery, peanuts and sesame seeds. 
                    Herbs and spices are a potent underpinning, including curry leaves 
                    (balmy herb), tamarind (sour pod), sour lime and spices such as 
                    mustard, ginger, turmeric, coriander, fenugreek, black pepper and 
                    the incendiary red Guntur chilies.
                    India's wealth of regional cuisines has acquired new prominence in 
                    the last four or five years. Local cooking styles and specialties, 
                    once dismissed as ordinary, have come into favor, and native cooks, 
                    once considered unrefined, have become celebrities. As a result, 
                    there is a far greater variety of regional foods available to 
                    travelers in South India than was the case just a few years ago.

                    &nbsp Vegetarian dishes, which originated in the Tanjore courts of 
                    Dravidian kings, are collectively known as South Indian vegetarian, 
                    or Tamil food. Throughout the south, dishes like sambar, kotto and 
                    koyamboo (spicy vegetable and lentil stews), kari or thovaran 
                    (warm vegetable salads), rasam (soup) and pachadi (yogurt salad) are

                    &nbsp Wheat, grown abundantly in the fertile lands of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, is 
                    a staple part of every North Indian diet, usually consumed as chapati or flatbread. 
                    This is served with a variety of curries.
                    Many North Indian Hindus are vegetarians although non-vegetarian fare is readily 
                    available in all parts of the region. North Indian curries are thick and creamy and 
                    sweets are found in almost every street corner.

                <p>
                    &nbsp Apart from art and architecture, the Mughals also brought their cuisine to North India. 
                    Mughlai food, with its full-bodied flavor, delicious aroma and distinctive cooking 
                    style, entices you especially in the streets of Old Delhi. Primarily meat-based, 
                    these dishes are popularly eaten in many other parts of India too. The Mughals are 
                    responsible for the advent of biryani which has certainly taken the nation by storm. 
                    Originally cooked with mutton and fine rice, biryani is said to have fed the millions 
                    of Mughal troops and keep them battle-ready!

                    &nbsp Punjabi food has a charm of its own. Generous doses of spices and ghee (clarified 
                    butter) characterizes Punjabi food and the area is known particularly for the numerous 
                    street-side dhabas, or indigenous restaurants that remain open all night to cater to

                    &nbsp East India is comprised of the states of West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, 
                    Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura, and Orissa. This region is home to beaches 
                    and mountains and Cherrapunji, the city with the highest rainfall in the world.
                    Because of the climate, Eastern India grows a lot of rice! Green vegetables and fruit 
                    are also abundant and thus are the recipes using them. People, though, are a balanced 
                    mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The geographical location of this region means 
                    its food bears the strong influence of Chinese and Mongolian cuisine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp Although East India has three schools of cuisine‚ÄîBengali and Assam, the Northeastern 
                    states and then Orissa‚Äîsimple is the keyword for food of this region. Preparation is 
                    not elaborate and neither are most of the ingredients. Steaming and frying are popular 
                    methods of cooking. In coastal regions fish is the food of choice while further inland 
                    pork wins the position on the plate. People of no other region in India can rival the 
                    Eastern Indians' love for sweets and desserts. Some of India's most popular and 
                    world-renowned sweets come from here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp East Indian cuisine's distinct character sets it apart from other areas of the country.
                    The dishes feature less spice than their neighboring regions' recipes, allowing the 
                    main ingredients to really shine through. The coastal section allows for a variety of 
                    fresh seafood, the warm climate and lush forest for ample produce. The European 
                    explorers and Muslim settlers left their mark, resulting in a unique style of cooking 
                    that is purely East Indian.
                    Some popular dishes are momos (steamed, meat- or vegetable-filled wontons) and Thukpa 
                    (a clear soup). Tomato Achaar (tomato pickle), Machcher Jhol (fish curry), and 
                    Jhaal-Muri (a spicy snack made with puffed rice and mustard oil) are also commonly 
                    seen on menus.<br><a href="./other_page/east_india.html" target="black page">Aquarium more kownledge about "East India's Food & Recipe".</a>

                    &nbsp The states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa make for the majority of western 
                    states of India. Diversity is one thing that is common across these regions - from 
                    culture and climate to food, you'll find a variety of it as you move from Rajasthan's 
                    Aravalli to the western coastline of Goa. Keeping up with India's cooking techniques 
                    and traditions, west Indian foods also boast of eclectic spices and a diverse range 
                    of dishes since the cuisine varies from region to region.
                    The state of Maharashtra covers a large part of western India. With Mumbai, Pune, 
                    Nashik and Nagpur being the largest cities, Maharashtra holds the status of being 
                    the second-most populous state in India, according to the 2011 national census. All 
                    of these states together offer a multifarious cuisine that keeps experimenting and 
                    reinventing new recipes that is rich in flavour. From Mumbai's vada pao and Bombay 
                    duck to modak and Pune's zunka bhakri, you'll have a hard time choosing what to try 
                    first. The Malvani cuisine is also prevalent in large parts of Maharashtra that uses 
                    a lot of dry-coconut.<br><a href="./other_page/west_india.html" target="black page">Aquarium more kownledge about "West India's Food & Recipe".</a>
